# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains my **Task 5 (EDA)** for the Data Analyst Internship.  
The project uses the Titanic dataset to explore relationships, trends, and patterns using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this task, I performed detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic `train.csv` dataset.  
The goal is to understand:

- Passenger demographics  
- Survival patterns  
- Correlation between features  
- Missing value handling  
- Feature engineering
